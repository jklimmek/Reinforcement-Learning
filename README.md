# Reinforcement Learning Zoo

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Zoo! This repository is a collection of diverse reinforcement learning algorithms designed to beat OpenAI's gym environments. The goal is to continuously expand the repo over time.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. Deep Q Network (DQN): This algorithm is one of the fundamental techniques in reinforcement learning, trained on LunarLander-v2.
