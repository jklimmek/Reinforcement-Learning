# Reinforcement Learning Zoo

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Zoo! This repository is a collection of diverse reinforcement learning algorithms designed to beat OpenAI's gym environments. The goal is to continuously expand the repo over time. For simplicity most of algorithms are trained on LunarLander-v2.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. Deep Q Network (DQN): Soft update of target network, trained on LunarLander-v2.
2. Policy Gradients (PG) - REINFORCE on LunarLander-v2.
3. Actor-Critic (AC) - Temporal Difference Actor-Critic trained on LunarLander-v2.
4. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) - Coming soon.
